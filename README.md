## Education

**B.A., Computer Science | Macaulay Honors at CUNY Hunter College (_Expected May 2026_)**

## Experience

**Data Science Fellow | Microsoft (_June 2024_)**

- Selected as 1 of 12 students from hundreds of applicants for a 4-week intensive data science program hosted by Microsoft Research NYC, gaining hands-on experience in data science methods
- Applied data analysis, wrangling, visualization, and machine learning techniques in R to successfully replicate key findings from existing research papers

**Robotics Research Assistant | Hunter College (_Jan 2024 - Present_)**

- Fine-tuned the DistilHuBERT model on the RAVDESS dataset to create a lightweight speech emotion recognition model with 82% accuracy using PyTorch and Transformers, enhancing robot interactive capabilities
- Developed a pipeline that integrates a deep learning emotion recognition model with autonomous robot actions using Python and ROS, enhancing the robot’s ability to respond to human emotions
- Integrated SemaFORR, a cognitively-based robot path planner, into robot software using Python, C++, and ROS

**Research Intern | h2ocleanse, LLC (_July 2023 - Aug 2023_)**

- Analyzed 40+ datasets and studies on PFAS chemicals in contaminated water, identifying and quantifying their negative effects on the population through data analysis
- Published a white paper to inform individuals, businesses, and government about the necessity of filtration systems for cleaning contaminated water, influencing policy and awareness

**Programming Team Leader (Team 14212) | FIRST Robotics Team (_Oct 2020 - June 2022_)**

- Led team to achieve 2nd place out of 19 in NYC Qualifier and 7th place out of 30 in NYC Championship for 2021-22 competition through strategic software development and teamwork
- Boosted team’s scoring potential by 217% by developing and implementing a finite state machine model and computer vision pipeline using Java
- Attained 90% autonomous success rate in competition by building a motor rotation tracking algorithm with Java

## Projects

### [Data Science Replication | R, tidyverse, dbplyr, lubridate](https://github.com/msr-ds3/immigrant-news-2024-group-6)

- Replicated key figures and regression models from the research paper “Anti-Immigrant Rhetoric and ICE Reporting Interest: Evidence from a Large-Scale Study of Web Search Data”
- Extended the research findings by refitting a regression model after standardizing a feature in the dataset, providing another perspective on the significance of the results

### [Stock Prediction | Python, Streamlit, yfinance, scikit-learn](https://github.com/ericguan04/stock_market_project)

- Web and machine learning app where users can input a ticker symbol to predict tomorrow’s stock price
- Trained a price prediction model on yfinance data using a Random Forest Classifier, achieving a 60% accuracy rate
